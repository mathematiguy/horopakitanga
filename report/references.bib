In this work, we analyze the effect of speaker role on language use through the game of Mafia, in which participants are assigned either an honest or a deceptive role. In addition to building a framework to collect a dataset of Mafia game records, we demonstrate that there are differences in the language produced by players with different roles. We confirm that classification models are able to rank deceptive players as more suspicious than honest ones based only on their use of language. Furthermore, we show that training models on two auxiliary tasks outperforms a standard BERT-based text classification approach. We also present methods for using our trained models to identify features that distinguish between player roles, which could be used to assist players during the Mafia game.",

abstract = {In intelligence, law enforcement, and, increasingly, organizational settings there is interest in detecting deception; for example, in intercepted phone calls, emails, and web sites. Humans are not naturally good at detecting deception, but recent work has shown that deception is actually readily detectable - using markers that humans don't see but which software can readily compute. Pennebaker's model suggests that deceptive communication is characterized by changes in the frequency of four kinds of words: first-person pronouns, exception words, negative emotion words, and action words.We investigate what can be learned about the deception model by applying it to a large corpus of Enron emails. We show that each of the four kinds of words in the Pennebaker model acts as a separate latent factor for deception, rather than having their effects mixed together.},

We show that hubristic tendencies can be detected semantically ex-ante in textual reports, and offer a novel methodology aimed at detecting real-time hubristic propensities. The methodology employs text mining based on natural language processing (NLP) on Enron email corpus. NLP can capture information about employees and predict change patterns. Employing NLP real-time mechanism, Enron executives' hubristic tendencies were detected. Findings indicate that hubristic expressions amongst senior executives are significantly more frequent than amongst their non-senior counterparts, and that the frequency of hubristic expressions increases the closer one gets to Enron's collapse. Whilst both Enron's CEO's were hubristic, we found Skilling to be typified with severer hubris. Our study is the first to employ NLP real-time analytical process to detect the hubris disposition. Predicated on Enron's case study, we demonstrate the methodology's strengths, notably immediate recognition of accumulated symptoms and prevalence.},

  abstract={ Sociolinguistics and computational linguistics literature have revealed negative correlations between social status and politeness in interpersonal conversations. In this article, we took a step further to uncover how social status and politeness interact with each other to jointly impact the efficiency of the Q\&A process in online social Q\&A communities. Using the data collected from two communities of Stack Exchange, we demonstrated that both social status and politeness had significant impacts to determine the efficiency of receiving acceptable answers. Moreover, while low-status users benefited from wording their questions more politely, high-status users were slightly “punished” for being too polite, particular in professional Q\&A communities. However, social status and politeness were not significantly relevant to whether a question could be eventually answered. In general, the social Q\&A process provides the conditions necessary for the manifestation of “offline” social norms. That is: individuals are still being rewarded for behaving correctly according to their social roles, no matter explicitly or implicitly. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this study.},
