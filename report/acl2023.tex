\begin{abstract}
In this paper we explore the possibility of identifying a fraudulent actor based on their language. We consider the email dataset of Enron employees which includes emails from convicted offenders and regular employees. We look at fraud through the prism of deception, verifying if known markers of deception correlate with fraud. We also look for new potential language markers that could correlate to fraud. The code is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mathematiguy/enron-nlp-analysis}}.
