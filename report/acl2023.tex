\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we attempt to design and test a learning system taking inspiration from a commonly used methodology for language teaching known as ``the Silent Way'' and operationalised by the Indigenous Māori community in New Zealand as ``Te Ataarangi''. We describe a dialogue agent system, and use the methodology to motivate a scalar-implicature game based on cuisenaire rods. We compose a dataset for solving this game, and implement a data-augmentation strategy, and a rule-based system using part of speech labels to cope with the low-resource nature of the problem.
